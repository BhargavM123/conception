# Conception

### An Idea Sharing Platform

Collection of Ideas on every niche

## Project Purpose

I am a huge enthusiast of open source. Contributing to open source is a fantastic way to learn and grow. Moreover, Conception is an idea sharing platform, where other than contributing code, you can contribute your ideas by writing your idea in a markdown file and raising a PR.

## General Idea

Conception is a platform where you can find ideas on every niche. Maybe you want to build a application but you may thinking for a best idea. In conception you can find ideas and bring that idea into real.

## Current State

As of now, Conception is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

Inorder to contribute ideas to Conception there is only one way (as of now). That is through writing your ideas in a Markdown file.

In future, Conception supports Strapi (Headless CMS) to write your ideas.

## Getting Started

### Project setup on your local machine

The easiest and quickest way to get the default project up and running locally is to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roopeshsn/conception.git
```

Now install packages with NPM:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API Information

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
