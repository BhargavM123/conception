# Sustainable and No Contact Attendance system

## Build a sustainable and no contact attendance system to contain the spread of corona virus

“Switch off” Biometric Attendance on March 5th, 2020 Delhi government announced the suspension of biometric attendance in its offices via a letter written to principal secretaries, secretaries, autonomous bodies, and municipal corporations for the suspension of biometric attendance to contain the spread of coronavirus. However, it was on Feb 17th, 2020 when Maharishi Valmiki Hospital in the Capital City of India suspended biometric attendance announcing it as a “precautionary measure” after many of its employees complained to the authorities that touching the biometric system is “psychological unease” on account of coronavirus scare. The need for the system is an untouchable device. And also students can't cheat with the system. Devise a secure way to take attendance of students and teachers in a touchless and paperless manner in order to have a sustainable way. This project aims to provide a touchless and paperless attendance system
