# Solar panel with solar tracking device without power consumption

## Build a solar panel with solar tracking device that should not consume power

It is well known that solar power production is maximum through solar panel when the sun is perpendicular to the solar panel. Number of solar tracking electronic devices have been made to align the solar panel with the sun. But they consume power and effectively power generation is not efficient. It is desired to make a solar panel tracker which does not consume power.
