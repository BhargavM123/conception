# Low cost condition monitoring of 3-Phase induction motor on PC

## Challenge description with context

Many Industrial Motors are installed in many in many applications in continuous plant industries like Pharmaceuticals, chemical, agro, food, textile etc. The motor installed is main component of the process. Hence, continuous observation is a part of regular maintenance. It is not possible all the time to visit each and every motor installed in whole industries. So, to keep constant watch on process, it is required to install device which gives constant data like winding temperature, vibration of shaft in X-Y direction. Different faults of an induction motor such as rotor, stator, bearing, vibration, air gap eccentricity and their different diagnosis techniques can be observed continuously. Low cost monitoring of Induction motor is most important part in all industries. If such type of monitoring system will be prepared, it will create great revolution in industries. With such prototype one can get above mention data on PC or mobile also. With this technology we can keep a bird's eye view on different types of faults and their diagnostics' schemes. Presently in market many such devices are available. But it leads to plant modifications and also its not cost effective solution. It also leads to shut down because of retrofication. If this problem solved, then new Induction Motor will be prepared with this technology Hence, task is to find out cost effective monitoring system.As mentioned earlier that, presently in market many such devices temperature sensors, vibration sensors etc are available. But it leads to plant modifications and also its not cost effective solution. Hence, cost effective technology can be put in to the market with solution of such problem

## Possible Solution

The different sensors are inserted in to Induction motor. These sensors are connected to external meters through wires or wireless. Hence constant monitoring will be possible.

## Expected Outcomes

Cost effective technology can be put in to the market with solution of such problem. with this technology preventive maintenance will be easy and cost effective.

## Potential Impact

Continuous monitoring will be possible at remote place or at the motor place. Hence, efficient operation of all continuous plant industries.
