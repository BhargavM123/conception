# Student Attendance System using Face Recognition

## Problem Statement

Existing paper based method is time consuming and distracting to both students as well as faculties. It is also prone to human errors. We propose a face recognition based smart attendance system. Student attendance can be made more robust. This also the reduces the administrative work of faculties. The attendance data can be stored on cloud for further processing.

## Possible Solution

We propose a face recognition with help of raspberry pi computer and mini camera based smart attendance system. By that way student attendance can be made more robust. This also the reduces the administrative work of faculties. The attendance data can be stored on cloud for further processing. That way we can sort out irregular students, less attendant student, punctual students in real time basis

## Expected Users

Any institute like Polytechnics, Degree colleges, Pharmacy Colleges, Medical Colleges, Any industry, Traffic points, Stampede prone area.students, faculty, HOD, Principal will be stake holders of the system

## Outcomes

The project aims to streamline the communication system in the organization. One of the biggest impact will be ease of communication and less dependence on paper based system. The project will reduce the communication time between different stakeholders and it can lead to higher efficiency of work. Also, using the single communication medium can increase the data security and data availability. Past data can also be easily be searched and recorded in organised manner.
